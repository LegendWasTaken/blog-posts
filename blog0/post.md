So, you may be asking youself. How'd you make this neat little website? Well let me guide you through when I first started trying to make this a thing, till now (When I'm writing this post).

Early 2021 I decided I should have sometype of internet prescene that wasn't social media or my youtube channel. A place dedicated for my ideas and knowledge. So, I decided to take the couple years of web development experience I have. And write a website for myself with it. This resulted in me downloading Figma, WebStorm, and node / npm. And then after a lot of looking at other peoples websites, and how they designed it. I came up with my first design iteration. (Which looked like crap in hindsight)

After making the frontend for this website (Which took under 2 hours, due to it's simple nature). I realized it looked horrible, decided to not finish or attempt to redo it. And left the project entirely for a couple of months. After returning, I decided to take a fresh look at some websites, and went for a twitter like look / feel for my website. Which looked a lot better, but felt a bit too much for me.

Then, after deciding I didn't like it (And was a bit much for me to make). I did another complete rewrite, which resulted in the website design you're seeing now (Assuming I haven't redone it...).

Now that you're all caught up on the projects history, let me explain the technologies and my design decisions. For the technology behind this project. I used ReactJS / Tailwind for the frontend. And for the backend I used Github and Imgur. Some people might be surprised at this, but my thought process behind this was that I needed a nice, simple, (relatively cheap or free) option to host my blog entries and images. And instead of going the normal route of renting a web server, setting up linux, and all. (Which I have done before for previous websites), I decided to go with the simple but effective route. I use a github [repository](https://github.com/LegendWasTaken/blog-posts/tree/main), for hosting my blog posts as markdown files. And then I use imgur as a place where I upload the images I use in my posts.

I don't have much more to say about how I made this website. It was a pretty straight forward process, that I enjoyed. I hope that this website will provide a place for me to put my thoughts, and knowledge where other people can access them, serving as a central hub for me.

~have fun nerds, till the next post
